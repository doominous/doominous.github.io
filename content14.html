	<p>During these 2 days:
		<ul>
			<li><p>I remembered, translated into my own language and modified the procedures for achieving goals</p></li>
			<li><p>I made a detailed learning and fun plan for six months<p></li>
			<li><p>I did my first python programming lessons</p></li>
			<li><p>I created my own learning system based on the study curriculum and materials I purchased from <a href="https://www.programujodpodstaw.pl" target="_blank">programujodpodstaw.pl</a></p></li>
			<li><p>I made a list of topics and keywords for the plan mentioned above</p></li>
			<li><p>I have collected and systematized the experiences that make me feel good and I can distinguish between being awake/aware, conscious dreaming, daydreaming, dreaming, sleeping and creating a visions - as separate states</p></li>
			<li><p><span id="RED">I also learned that everything matters, from matter/objects, through the body, words, thoughts, visions, emotions and dreams... to the one who looks at it all... I learned to stop/slow down the excessive flow, by the so-called. meditation. I appreciate everything I went through to understand this.</span></p></li>
