	<h2>14.15.16/03/2023</h2>
	<p>Tuesday the 14th, I've been working with firewood almost all day. In the evening, I started with JavaScript. I used the "Spaces" feature on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">w3schools.com</a></p>
	<p>On Wednesday 15th, I installed <a href="https://www.wampserver.com/en/" target="_blank">WampServer</a> to check the functionality of the site locally more conveniently.</p>
	<p>Thursday 16th, I added buttons to the website and created functions in JavaScript to change the style of my website. I push my work to <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a></p>
	<p>During these three days I also learned to add the "defer" attribute when placing a JavaScript function in an external file when placing a script in an HTML file.</p>
