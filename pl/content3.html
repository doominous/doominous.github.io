	<p>Looking through <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">w3schools.com</a> i find Git tutorial, as I have heard before that <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a> and <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> is worth of interest, I'm trying to find out about it. So I read some articles with the intention of knowing it better. I set up Git on my PC I set up Git with GitHub. I create my first repository on GitHub and I push my work to GitHub. I remembered some CSS styles and i've made separate file with styles.</p>
