	<p>During these 2 days:
		<ul>
			<li><p>I practice touch typing.</p></li>
			<li><p><span id="RED">I have noticed that often my head is in a panic. I'm always in a hurry, scared and rushed... under the influence of this shadow of the past. I discovered and understood that panic is one of my main obstacles to learning... and most importantly to being happy... being myself. And I've learned that silence, calm and inner peace are the only weapons against panic... and that it's not just where you're going, it's how you travel. It would be best if I remembered that lesson. So I pray in silence, silence.</span></p></li>
			<li><p>I rest and clean</p></li>
