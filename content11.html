	<p>During these 2 days:
		<ul>
			<li><p>I'm resting</p></li>
			<li><p><span id="RED">I am learning that emotions perfectly reveal attachments.I find a few more treasures buried in my mind...among other things, I find myself bitter about forcing myself to be joyful. So I allow myself to be furious, sad or angry, and to feel and look at other emotions. From now on, I try to ask myself what emotions I feel and what attachment they come from. I'm also learning some theory about trauma.
