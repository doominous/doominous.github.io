	<p>The first thing i mean is starting with HTML, so I hit to the page: <a href="https://www.kurshtml.edu.pl/index.html" target="_blank">kurshtml.edu.pl</a> soon after, I hit to the page <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">w3schools.com</a> I'm looking around and I notice a lot more tutorials than just HTML and I think, that is it! It will be a good place to learn. I am setting up a free account. I've made some lessons index file, is created</p>
