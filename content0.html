	<h2>Idea for learning</h2>
	<p>In 2009, shortly after graduating from high school, I became mentally ill with a chronic illness. It's 2023, it's been about 5 years since I have been taking medication regularly, functioning well and in remission. In the period between 2009-2013, I took up higher education twice, unfortunately I did not finish any of the courses I started. In 2015 I graduated from a post-high school for adults and obtained a diploma in IT technician. It's March 2023, it's been 8 years since receiving the diploma.</p>

	<p>The idea is: from today I start learning computer science and document my progress. I am curious if I will be able to continue my studies and if I will be able to work in IT in time.</p>
